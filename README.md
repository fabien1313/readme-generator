  ## Description
  This repository hosts a backend program using Node.js. Within this program I have built in questions for a user to answer that will then be formatted into a professional README.md file. The format follows the professional README.md file guidelines however, the current version excludes a particular question to add screenshots of the project or application. Upon using this application once the questions have been answered and your README.md file is created you can edit and add screenshots specific to your file structure for your project. There are eleven questions to help cover the format guidelines such as (title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, License, contributing, tests, and questions) as well as a few additional questions diving into the technologies used. This application helps programmers generate a quality README.md without having to question format guidelines. Now, you can answer questions that pertain to every project and have a professional README.md file generated just for you!

  ## Installation
  You will need to clone or download the zip file for this repository in order to run this application in VS Code or your preferred code editor. You will need to include a package.json which can be created using the command (npm init.) This command will provide you with a file (node_modules.) Now, you will need to download inquirer. I recommend using the command (npm i inquirer@8.2.4) which is the current version at the time this project is being created. Following these steps you can use the command (node index.js) to run the program in the terminal of the code editor.

 ## Tests
 A test that can be performed on this project would be running the command (node index.js) to ensure the questions are populating in the desired order as well as being written to the appropriate file. This test is vital to the functionality of the program. Without the the population of questions and writefile code neither the questions nor the codes ability to transfer your answer to the correct file form would be useful.
